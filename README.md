# Music App
This project "Music App" is basically a UI sample. It contains different screens within it, 
Home, Browse and Library Screen. The screens contains information about different category 
songs like Hits, workout, yoga etc. 
It also has other features like there is an Account clickable at the top bar which opens a drawer 
and has options for the User's Account, Subscriptions and Add Account. However, The screens for these 
clickables have not been implemented yet.
At the top right corner of the App, there is a three dots, More Action Button which is a clickable and opens 
a pop up containing 3 options: Settings, Share and Help, which again have not been implemented to have a screen.

*As told previously this is just a UI of a Music App and not a real app that can play songs, since it is not connected to any 
music database of its own.*
<br>
**However, Updates will be there for this app from time time to make its UI better and to Add more features.**
